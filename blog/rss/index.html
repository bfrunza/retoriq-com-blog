In fact, cognitive psychologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bruner">Jerome Bruner</a> suggested that <strong>people remember stories up to 22 times more than plain facts or statistics</strong>. </p><p>So why not incorporate all that compelling data you have about your company and product into a well-crafted story that touches both on the emotional and rational part of your customers and investors&#x2019; brains? </p><p>Storytelling may be the one thing missing from your startup business strategy. To help you change this, I&#x2019;ll elaborate on the long answer in the following. </p><p><strong>First things first, let&#x2019;s see what brand storytelling actually means.</strong> </p><p>The Internet abounds in definitions of <em>business/corporate/brand storytelling</em>, all of which revolve around the idea of <strong>connecting brands and customers through the use of stories</strong>. </p><p>Sounds pretty easy, right? </p><p>Well, while &#x201C;easy&#x201D; might not be the right word to describe it, the bottom line is that <strong>storytelling isn&#x2019;t magic </strong>either. </p><p>You don&#x2019;t need to spend ridiculous amounts of money or hold an impossible set of skills to get it done, but <strong>you do need empathy, authenticity and a bit of inspiration. &#xA0;</strong></p><p>Still, since there are so many misconceptions meant to transform storytelling into something almost mystical and out of reach for the &#x201C;ordinary&#x201D; companies, &#xA0;I will take a different approach and hint at what storytelling actually is by showing you all the things it isn&#x2019;t.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="misconception1storiesandbusinessdontmatch">Misconception #1: Stories and business don&#x2019;t match.</h1>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You may be asking yourself &#x201C;<em>what do stories and businesses have in common?</em>&#x201D;. And the first answer that comes to mind is probably &#x201C;<em>nothing&#x201D;</em>. </p><p>For all I know,<strong> businesses </strong><em><strong>are </strong></em><strong>stories</strong>. </p><p>Your business is the story of all the late nights you&#x2019;ve spent turning your ideas into a business plan, the story of how you&#x2019;ve found the right people who helped you make your ideas happen, the story of creating a product that convinces your customers to choose your brand. </p><p>Even if you never really told those stories out loud, you have crafted them word by word, brick by brick, as you created your startup. </p><blockquote><strong>Businesses and stories have a natural link:</strong> <strong>they support each other and they emerge from one another.</strong> And instead of denying or ignoring the existence of this link, you might as well capitalize on it. </blockquote><p>People crave stories and this is equally true when it comes to spending their money. </p><p>Although it might seem counterintuitive, <strong>customers don&#x2019;t buy products, they buy stories.</strong> &#xA0;</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484373030460-8de45ac8796d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Why Your Startup Needs Storytelling" loading="lazy"><br>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Whether you realize it or not, from the moment you&#x2019;ve decided to set your company up, you&#x2019;ve already stepped into the &#x201C;grown-up&#x201D; business world. </p><p><strong>Your company is already a brand and you need to make sure it acts like one. </strong></p><p>Having a brand doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean owning a company the size and magnitude of <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Nike</strong> or <strong>Microsoft</strong>. </p><p>It means having a business that holds a unique set of features and works to make the life of its customers a bit better, easier or more enjoyable. </p><p>Maybe you feel like there&#x2019;s nothing unique about your brand if you&#x2019;re into, let&#x2019;s say, the printing business. But you&#x2019;re wrong. </p><blockquote>That uniqueness that makes brands brands has nothing to do with the uniqueness of your business idea or services, but instead, <strong>it has a lot to do with your company&#x2019;s purpose, its staff, its customers and, most importantly, with the way you manage to connect these three key elements of your business. </strong></blockquote><p>So, now that we&#x2019;ve agreed that you do own a brand, let&#x2019;s move on and see why the size of it doesn&#x2019;t matter when it comes to storytelling. </p><p>Storytelling is not the benefit that you reap after becoming famous, but instead, it is the way you make your brand known to the world. </p><blockquote>In other words, <strong>your company doesn&#x2019;t need to be successful to tell its story, but it needs to tell its story to become successful. </strong></blockquote><p>Letting people in on the history and journey that you and your company had even before launching it, or during its first years, is the thing that can set you apart from your competitors and give you that much sought-after element of uniqueness. </p><p>Storytelling can also bring you closer to your customers since it is easier for them to relate to the people behind the brand, their struggles, vulnerabilities or passions, than it is to get closer to a legal entity. </p><p><strong>People may not be loyal to a product, but they will be loyal to a good product that comes with an authentic story. </strong></p><p>That&#x2019;s why you need to tell them your story even if you just got started, and that&#x2019;s how you make your brand BIG. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="misconception3startupscantaffordastorytellingdepartment">Misconception #3: Startups can&#x2019;t afford a storytelling department.</h1>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Well, guess what? You don&#x2019;t even need one. </p><p>While being a gifted storyteller or having one in your company may be an advantage, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that you can&#x2019;t do without one. </p><p>Of course, some companies have set up an entire department dedicated to creating quality content and stories to support their brand, while others have even created a new executive position for this job, the so-called CSO - <a href="https://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/what-is-a-chief-storyteller-five-business-leaders-share-their-stories/">Chief Storytelling Officer</a>. </p><p>And that&#x2019;s great, but <strong>it&#x2019;s not the end of the world if your company can&#x2019;t afford that yet</strong>. You still have a lot of options at hand if you just get a bit creative and improvise within the limits of your budget.</p><p><strong>One thing you can do is outsource the duties of a storyteller and reach the services of a freelance writer using platforms such as <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/hire/storytelling">Fiverr </a>or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/hire/storytelling-freelancers/">Upwork</a>.</strong> </p><p>These platforms bring together people who need specific services, but don&#x2019;t want to hire someone full or part-time to get the job done, with people looking for one-time gigs who will offer their services for a very affordable price. </p><p>You might have even used them for other jobs, why not do so for your brand storytelling?</p><p>It&#x2019;s cheap, it&#x2019;s fast and it gets things done without the trouble of having to hire one new employee or set up a new team. </p><p>This may not be the dream storytelling strategy, but it does the trick for companies that have just started and don&#x2019;t have too much money to invest, and it&#x2019;s also better than not telling your story at all. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="misconception4mycompanydoesnthaveastorytotell">Misconception #4: My company doesn&#x2019;t have a story to tell.</h1>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>These are only a few questions you can ask yourself when trying to figure out where to begin your story, but, of course, there are many other approaches you can take.</p><blockquote><strong>When it comes to storytelling, the sky&apos;s the limit.</strong> </blockquote><p>If big brands&#x2019; stories are not something you can relate to in terms of inspiration, and you&#x2019;re looking for ideas from companies that are more the age and size of your own company, then you might want to check out <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ugmonk/analog-the-simplest-productivity-system?ref=discovery_popular">Kickstarter</a>. </p><p>Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform built around the concept of business storytelling, where entrepreneurs are trying to attract investors by pitching their product through a compelling, persuasive story.</p><p>Practicing storytelling on the company&#x2019;s <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/content-marketing-thought-leaders/2017/why-you-should-tell-your-brand-s-origin-story-and-how-to-do-it">origin story</a> is useful for any new entrepreneur since it helps you find and define your business&#x2019;s identity and purpose. </p><p><strong>Getting closer to the core of your business will reflect in the quality of your products/services, of your management and, inevitably, on the quality of your content marketing.</strong></p><p>Which leads us to the next point.</p><h3 id="what-other-stories-can-you-tell-and-where-do-you-tell-them">What other stories can you tell and where do you tell them?</h3><p>First of all, you should note that <strong>storytelling is not just a one-time affair</strong>.</p><blockquote><strong>Constant storytelling grows and strengthens your brand. </strong></blockquote><p>This means that posting a story about your firm in the &#x201C;<em>About Us</em>&#x201D; section of your website, though important, is not enough. Then what is?</p><p>The origin story of your brand can definitely serve as a starting point. However, you can&#x2019;t rely solely on that one story to make your business known to the world.</p><p>Instead, you want to <strong>continue to spread the core message of your business by constantly showing how it reflects in your company&#x2019;s daily activity. </strong></p><p>This is why storytelling should be part of your business and develop along with your products or services. </p><p>Take a look at Microsoft, for example. They have an entire <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/about/">section</a> on their website dedicated to storytelling and, among other stories, they also share the company&apos;s journey pictured as a timeline of important events that constantly shape the brand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://retoriq.com/blog/content/images/2020/07/About-Microsoft-Stories.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why Your Startup Needs Storytelling" loading="lazy" width="1555" height="998" srcset="https://retoriq.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/About-Microsoft-Stories.png 600w, https://retoriq.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/About-Microsoft-Stories.png 1000w, https://retoriq.com/blog/content/images/2020/07/About-Microsoft-Stories.png 1555w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There are many ways for you to do this as well. </p><p>Are you researching a new, improved version of your product? <strong>Share the story of the excitement and challenges you and your team are experiencing throughout this process.</strong></p><p>Are you involved in community service?<strong> Let the world know about the problems you&#x2019;re trying to solve.</strong></p><p>Have your sales grown consistently? <strong>Tell a good story to publicly thank your employees for their efforts and your customers for their loyalty.</strong></p><p>And most importantly, <strong>talk about your clients.</strong> Ask for their permission to share some feedback or show how customers interact with your products or services by sharing some insights from their daily experiences with your brand.</p><p>There are numerous channels you can use to spread your message, and the good news is that most of them are free. <strong>Social media</strong> is one of the most accessible resources.</p><p>Why not use your company&#x2019;s <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, or <strong>Instagram</strong> account to post your company&#x2019;s updates, announcements and achievements?

You can keep them engaged by sending them <strong>newsletters</strong> with useful information or stories that will help you gain their loyalty.</p><p>Last but not least, <strong>blog</strong>. According to <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics">HubSpot&#x2019;s 2020 marketing report</a>, blogs are among the primary three forms of media used in content strategies today. </p><blockquote>Having a blog linked to your company&#x2019;s website and consistently publishing quality content is one of the most inexpensive ways to attract new customers and boost your company&#x2019;s sales. </blockquote><h3 id="but-how-do-you-keep-your-publishing-organized">But how do you keep your publishing organized?</h3><p>OK, so now that we&#x2019;ve seen what business storytelling is, why your company needs it and how you can implement these storytelling ideas, let&#x2019;s see how you can organize your storytelling process and not get lost on the way. &#xA0;</p><p>Even though you may not consider it a priority when there are a ton of other things on your to-do list, try to treat publishing as you do your other tasks and offer it a spot on this list. </p><p>Do this by creating a <strong>publishing calendar </strong>and commit to following your deadlines. </p><p>In terms of scheduling, you can organize your storytelling activity by using your <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Outlook</strong> <strong>calendar</strong>, but there are also other dedicated apps or platforms such as <strong><a href="https://trello.com/b/UQk1wa4a/editorial-calendar">Trello</a> </strong>that can help you keep track of your editorial work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src="https://retoriq.com/blog/content/images/2020/07/Editorial-Calendar-Trello.png" alt="Why Your Startup Needs Storytelling" loading="lazy"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>But all of these mean that you must first have some content you want to publish. </p><p>We all know <strong>ideas don&#x2019;t grow on trees and that they are especially difficult to find when we need them most.</strong> </p><p>Because you never know when inspiration strikes, and losing a good idea is even worse than not having one in the first place, you should always keep at hand an <strong>ideas journal. </strong>Whether it&apos;s a notebook or an app, it must be easy to use and within reach at any given time. </p><p>You can try apps like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> to save ideas that you can later turn into blog posts, newsletter or social media content. </p><p>There are tons of business productivity tools out there, you just need to figure out what works best for you and your company, and use those that make your life a bit easier. </p><h3 id="happy-ending">Happy ending</h3><p>Although this is a time when you might feel like you could use some extra 24 hours in a day, the fact that you&#x2019;re just starting may turn out to be a huge advantage for you and your company in terms of communication and marketing. </p><p>A &#xA0;fresh start means you have the chance to position your brand on the market by telling the story you would like people to remember, a story that was never told before. </p><p>Think of it as the first blank page of your company&#x2019;s greater story and seize the opportunity to create a narrative that no one can forget. </p><blockquote>Be authentic and put a friendly human figure on your brand. </blockquote><p>Oh, and stay confident. <strong>Ultimately, all your hard work </strong><em><strong>will</strong></em><strong> pay off.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Bold and the Beautiful: a legal drama series]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why is it that some lawyers win more cases than others?

You might call them lucky, you might think they&#x2019;re born with a legal genius or both. Well, that would leave most of us with nothing else to do other than envy them, admire them or hire them. But let me tell you this: it&#x2019;s neither luck nor inborn talent that wins your cases. <br></p><p>Then what&apos;s the difference between a good lawyer and a successful lawyer? Luckily, it&#x2019;s all about technique&#x2014;specifically, the writing techniques that turn a good lawyer into a good lawyer-writer, the good lawyer-writer into an articulate lawyer and, eventually, the articulate lawyer into that successful lawyer all of us dream of becoming.<br></p><p>The first step to mastering these techniques is to show your availability to learn new skills no matter if you&#x2019;ve just graduated or if you&#x2019;ve already been practising law for 20 years.<br></p><p>The second step is to get rid of the bad habits you&#x2019;ve been thoroughly building throughout the years. To become better, you should do less. Less of the bad things. And if you&#x2019;re having trouble figuring out what those bad things are, I&#x2019;m here to help you identify and correct the mistakes that you&#x2014;knowingly or unknowingly, but repeatedly&#x2014;commit. Because that&#x2019;s what lawyers are for. I mean friends.<br></p><p>Are you familiar with the CTRL-B, CTRL-U, CAPS-LOCK keystroke combinations? Do you tend to use them often in your legal writing? Well, if your answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, I have good news and not-so-good news for you. The good news is that you seem to be a tech-savvy lawyer. And that&#x2019;s a laudable achievement. The bad news is that your writing skills may not match your technical skills. <br></p><p>Just to make sure everyone follows, I&#x2019;m talking about those briefs in which some lawyers feel the need to point out that the opposing counsel&#x2019;s arguments are not just bald assertions, but <strong>BALD ASSERTIONS.</strong><br></p><p>When writing, lawyers tend to be more lawyers than writers and resort to the same persuasion tools they use in their oral presentations, hoping to get the same effect. And just like that, out of lawyerly reflex, they transfer their pitch to paper hitting the CTRL-B, CTRL-U keyboard shortcuts convinced that the voice in their readers&#x2019; heads will sound just as angry as the inner voice that instilled the decision to bold, or better yet bold and underline, that sentence. The result? A print version of yelling. Writing your sentences in all-caps, underline or bold is just as useful as shouting to make your point. <br></p><p>As a lawyer, I&#x2019;ve stumbled upon many pieces of writing overdosed on typographical emphasis and I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if the writers, my fellow lawyers, actually believed a boldface sentence makes a stronger point or if they were consciously turning to these gimmicks to direct their readership&#x2019;s attention to the ferocity of their outrage and away from the frailty of the legal argument. <br></p><p>Call me naive, but I used to (and still) believe that an inherently strong argument does not require typeface props to stand out. <br></p><p>While it&#x2019;s true that emphasis and pitch variation can be effective in oral presentations, employing the same rhetorical devices in writing does not necessarily translate into the same level of persuasion. Most of the time it does the exact opposite. <br></p><p>First of all, writing <strong>LIKE THIS </strong>is <strong>distracting! </strong>Especially since understanding and interpreting legal writing is already a complex and exhausting endeavour itself. Following the logical thread of a legal argument requires concentration and can put to test even the sharpest minds. Underlined or all-caps parts of text make the readers&#x2019; eyes automatically turn to those words, causing them to lose focus on the rest of the sentences and, eventually, miss the point. And this is bad unless you are using this trick to conceal your otherwise flawed legal reasoning. <br></p><p>Second, it undermines credibility and affects the lawyer&#x2019;s standing. In rhetoric, one of the main pillars of persuasion is <em>ethos</em>, which can be translated as the speaker&#x2019;s (or writer&#x2019;s) character. The first step towards persuading someone to accept your argumentation as valid is gaining their trust. Unlike speaking, getting someone to trust you through your writing is far more difficult, so you need to play your cards right. A confident writer is not afraid to rely solely on the soundness of their reasoning without feeling the need to point out their words. Someone who constantly deploys such tricks comes off as deceptive and dramatic. Your goal is to be seen as honest, not deceptive; persuasive, not dramatic. <br></p><p>Third, it&#x2019;s offensive to the reader&#x2019;s intelligence. Judges can pick up emphasis without you pointing it out for them, so while your intention may be to downplay the opposing counsel&#x2019;s thesis, you may end up insulting the judge. Most people can tell when they are being played and your efforts to distract them from a shaky argument can come across as offensive.<br></p><p>Before moving on to the cure, I must raise one final problem: the exclamation mark. The use of this punctuation mark comes with a similar set of troubles. It&#x2019;s loud, tacky, and adds unnecessary drama to your writing. My advice on using the exclamation mark? Don&#x2019;t use it unless you feel the compulsive need to yell at your reader. Which, by the way, you should never ever do. The exclamation mark does not belong to any piece of legal writing and it certainly does not belong to the emails you&#x2019;re writing, so the next time you see any of your sentences ending with &#x201C;!&#x201D;, take a deep breath, delete it, and replace it with the good old &#x201C;.&#x201D;.<br></p><p>Ok, so now that we&#x2019;ve taken the bold, the underline, the all-caps and the exclamation mark out of our writing, the question arises: how on Earth are we supposed to emphasize our point and convey the tone of our voice without pointing out our words?<br></p><p>Fortunately, there are other smarter methods. <br></p><p>One of the easiest yet powerful ways to make your argument stand out is to concentrate key messages in short sentences. Short sentences stick. They are easy to grasp, easy to remember and almost as easy to spot by your readers as an underlined phrase. The trick to emphasizing short sentences is to alternate them with longer sentences to prevent your text from becoming dull and help your reader identify the core ideas in your writing. <br></p><p>When possible, try placing these sentences at the end of the paragraph. As human beings, we are conditioned to search for the important part at the end of anything. Whether it&#x2019;s the end of a movie, a book or that creamy last bit of an ice cream cone, endings leave a lasting impression in our minds. Strategically placing that short, punchy line at the end of the paragraph will get you two additional advantages: (i) the white space that follows will draw the reader&#x2019;s attention to this final sentence and (ii) thanks to the natural longer pause between paragraphs, your concluding sentence will have more time to sink in. <br></p><p>And yet, conciseness alone will not do the trick. Short sentences only work if the language you&#x2019;re using to emphasize your point is clear and simple. Think about making your ideas clear even to someone who&#x2019;s dealing with your subject for the first time, and try as much as you can to strip off the meaningless legalese, any unnecessary words, circular constructions, and pompous expressions. You might find this unacceptable and even offensive to your lawyerly ego&#x2014; after all, sounding like a lawyer is the exclusive privilege of people who went to law school and many of us take great pride in it&#x2014; but you will thank yourself for this later. <br></p><p>Take for example this sentence: <em>&#x201C;From the evidence, it appears that five shots from an automatic .32 calibre pistol were fired by the defendant, four of them taking effect in the body of the decedent.&#x201D; </em>If we apply the principles listed above and try to make it more clear and concise, it would look like this: <em>&#x201C;Mr X shot his wife four times and killed her.&#x201D; </em>This revision shows how you can emphasize your message and make it more impactful with a short, punchy sentence&#x2014;no bold, no underline, no exclamation mark. As always, moderation is key. To get this effect, the sentence length should vary throughout your writing, otherwise, you may end up with a choppy, subpar text. <br></p><p>Finally, it all comes down to common sense. All these tips I&#x2019;ve shared with you are basic traits that no one ever questions and that everyone takes for granted. Clarity, brevity, moderation, civility should not only define the writing, but also the writer, and especially the lawyer-writer. <br></p><p>Being a lawyer is one of those professions that forces you to become a writer overnight. Most of us fail not because we don&#x2019;t &#x201C;have what it takes&#x201D;, but because we don&#x2019;t realise the importance of this skill and we stubbornly believe it cannot be acquired. And as it turns out, good writing is something you can and should learn. Better writing, better lawyer. The better you become at writing, the more successful you will be as a lawyer. <br></p><p>So save the drama. Be bold enough to drop the Bold; raise the bar, not your voice; make your point without pointing it out and success will follow. Not because you get lucky, not because you become a legal genius, but because you&#x2019;ve found the method. It&#x2019;s that simple.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Your Body Can Help Improve Your Presentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[30 seconds.

Others say it takes only 7 seconds. </p><p>Whatever study you choose to believe, one thing is for sure:<strong> people will decide whether they like you or not in these first few seconds and whether or not they will pay attention to what you&#x2019;re about to say.</strong></p><p>So, before you even start speaking you are already liked or disliked by your audience. </p><p>That&#x2019;s harsh, isn&#x2019;t it? </p><p>What can you do to make the most of these seconds and get people to listen to you?</p><p><strong>First thing, posture. </strong></p><p>The way you enter the room or the stage, the way you walk, and, most importantly, the way you stand when you deliver a presentation is crucial to your success as a speaker. </p><blockquote><strong>Good posture builds confidence.</strong> It gains the confidence of your audience and helps you be more confident in yourself as you speak. </blockquote><p>You can tell when speakers are nervous based on their posture: they tend to get small and unbalanced when they stand in front of an audience. They fidget, they lean, they hunch and tilt their heads. </p><p>On the other hand, confident speakers are balanced, they step forward, their shoulders are square, hips are in line and they keep their heads straight. </p><p>When you present, you want to be<strong> big and balanced, not small and retracted. </strong></p><p>Easier said than done, I know. </p><p>Good news is that we are not born good speakers, this is a skill that you can learn like speaking a foreign language. </p><p>One shortcut to achieving this, that may actually work, is: <strong>fake it till you make it.</strong> </p><p>When you begin to act confidently, your audience will perceive you as being confident, and by being treated as one, you begin to feel that way. </p><p>There are also some steps that you can follow, so I&#x2019;m going to give you a few tips on posture and movement.</p><p>First of all, <strong>being balanced and keeping your head straight does not mean that you must not move in order to look confident. </strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src="https://retoriq.com/blog/content/images/2020/07/Canva---Brown-and-White-2-Legged-Animal-Standing-on-Tree-Branch--1-.jpg" alt="How Your Body Can Help Improve Your Presentation" loading="lazy"><br>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote><strong>Movement is acceptable when delivering a speech, as long as you do it consciously</strong>. </blockquote><p>You can do it at the beginning of your speech, when you ask questions or during transitions from one topic to another. </p><p>I&#x2019;ll explain. </p><p>When you first make your appearance in front of your audience, you should move forward, towards the people you are addressing your speech. </p><p>You want to start by getting closer to people, not further away. </p><p>You might feel threatened by your audience, but you don&#x2019;t want to show them you feel that way because <strong>by creating this physical distance, you also distance your audience mentally </strong>and your message will not get across. </p><p>Instead, you want to bring them closer and draw their attention to you. </p><p>You achieve this by stepping forward when you start speaking. </p><p>So, <strong>step one: move forward towards your audience when you begin your speech.</strong> </p><p>Same rule applies when you want to emphasize a point in your speech. </p><p><strong>Step two: move forward into the questions. </strong></p><p>This means that whenever you are addressing a question to the public or someone in the public asks you a question, you should move forward, closer to the audience or to that part of the audience where the question came from. </p><p>However, you should keep in mind that when answering a question asked by one person in the audience, you should not look only at that person, instead you should orient your answer towards your entire audience. </p><p>Otherwise, people might feel like that is a conversation that only concerns the two of you and switch off their attention.</p><p><strong>Step three: move side to side during transitions.</strong> </p><blockquote>A clever way to insert movement in your presentation is to mark the transition from one idea to another by physically transitioning towards the other side of the stage. </blockquote><p>Obviously, this doesn&apos;t mean going from one end of the stage to the other. The transition can be very subtle, one or two side steps, just enough to switch to another topic without distracting the audience with your move. </p><p><strong>Don&#x2019;t overdo it, though, you don&#x2019;t want to make your audience feel like they&#x2019;re watching a tennis match. </strong></p><p>You can also mark a natural change to a different topic by taking a step back. This way, you get to draw your audience back into the subject and help them follow the structure of your speech more easily. </p><p>One final tip. </p><p>Even though we have shown that not looking like a statue when giving a presentation is very important, please bear in mind that <strong>movement is not recommended during key messages.</strong> </p><p>So, by all means, whenever you want to make an important point in your speech, pause, <strong>make eye contact and emphasize your message with gestures, tone of voice or facial expressions</strong>, but do not move unconsciously while saying it if you want your message to stick.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>First impressions are crucial and you have only a few seconds to make it or break it.</li>

Too many slides, too many words.</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If someone asks you to review their PowerPoint presentation, there&#x2019;s a 99% chance to be right if you tell them they have too many slides and way too many words on them. </p><p>And that&#x2019;s without even opening their slideshow. </p><p><strong>Excessive use of slides and words might be the one fundamental truth about every PowerPoint presentation. </strong></p><p>Sounds familiar? Well, if it does, the good news is you do have the power to break this bad habit.</p><p>One powerful antidote is <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/"><strong>Guy Kawasaki&#x2019;s 10/20/30 rule</strong></a>, that stands for 10 slides, 20 minutes, 30 points font. </p><p><strong>10</strong> is the optimal number of slides in a presentation and the simple reason for it is that people in your audience won&#x2019;t be able to grasp more than 10 ideas that are being presented to them. </p><p>So, you should pick the most important points in your speech and turn them into 10 simple slides that will make your message stick.</p><p><strong>20 minutes </strong>is the recommended duration of an effective presentation<strong>.</strong> </p><p>People don&#x2019;t really like it when things take too much of their time and this translates into a short attention span. So, even if you have a time slot of, let&#x2019;s say, 1 hour, try making your presentation shorter if you want to enjoy the audience&#x2019;s attention throughout the entire talk. </p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s better to leave your audience wanting more than draining their energy, which will only make them want to escape that conference room. </strong></p><blockquote>You should keep your audience&#x2019;s time investment low and their level of interest high. </blockquote><p><strong>30 points font. </strong>This is the recommended size for the font you will use on your slides if you want to make sure everyone in the audience can read your message. </p><p>Another benefit is that it will prevent you from overloading the slides with information that will be both difficult to read and difficult to understand.</p><p>If this size is not suitable for your presentation, there&#x2019;s another formula you can apply. You take the oldest person in the audience and divide their age by 2. That&#x2019;s the font size you should use. So, if the oldest person is, let&#x2019;s say, &#xA0;50, use a 25 points font.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="2slidesoverspeaker">2. Slides over speaker.</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote><strong>First question you should ask yourself when working on a presentation is: &quot;do I really need slides?&quot;.</strong></blockquote><p>I know this may sound crazy. </p><p>However, while it is true that PowerPoint can boost your presentation and make it memorable, this only happens when you use this tool in a wise, moderate and professional manner. </p><p>Poor use of slides don&#x2019;t just distract the audience&#x2019;s attention from your message, but can even ruin your presentation. </p><p>If you decide to use them, keep in mind that <strong>your slides are there to serve you, not the other way around. </strong></p><p>There were good presentations even before PowerPoint, which can lead to one of the following conclusions: </p><p>First, slides are meant to make your talk better, not replace it. </p><p>Second, you can do even without them. </p><p><strong>We only have one language processor and we can use it either to read the slides or listen to the speaker. </strong></p><p>When you put all the information you want to share with the audience on a screen, their attention will focus on reading the slides, because they will do it faster than you speak, and they will not listen to you anymore. </p><blockquote>So, please remember this: you want your slides to be the condiments on your plate, not the main dish. </blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="3makingpowerpointyourteleprompter">3.

Use simple words and short sentences.</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>While this piece of advice might have gotten you a poor grade in writing class, it can now get you a big round of applause at the end of your presentation.</p><p><strong>First, keep your words simple. </strong></p><p>And it&#x2019;s not just me who says this, Winston Churchill also made this point with his famous quote:<em> <strong>&#x201C;Short words are best, and old words, when short, are best of all&#x201D;.</strong></em></p><p>In other words, why say &#x201C;utilize&#x201D; when you can say &#x201C;use&#x201D;?</p><p>Just to be clear, using simple words does not mean writing dull content. </p><blockquote>On the contrary, the ability to put big ideas in simple words is a sign that you have mastered both your subject and the art of speechwriting. &#xA0;</blockquote><p>It is also a huge favor you&#x2019;re doing your audience, as they can follow your speech more easily and not get bored on the way. </p><p><strong>Second, try to stay away from complicated, wordy sentences that are both tiring and difficult to grasp.</strong> </p><blockquote>When it comes to sentences, the best thing you can do is keep them short. </blockquote><p>One way to simplify and shorten your sentences is to <strong>use active voice</strong> instead of passive voice. </p><p>This method helps you state your verb early in the sentence and, thus, helps deliver your message more clearly. </p><p>For example, instead of <em>&#x201C;In order to sound good, speeches should be written using simple sentences.&#x201D;, </em>try saying<em> &#x201C;Simple sentences make your speech sound good&#x201D;. </em></p><p>See the difference?</p><p>Also, another way to avoid lengthy sentences is to <strong>break dependent clauses into separate sentences. </strong></p><p>For instance, the sentence <em>&#x201C;Tom, whose speeches always sound good, has been awarded first prize in this year&#x2019;s international public speaking competition.&#x201D; </em>might sound unnecessarily formal and wordy. </p><p>Instead, you can simply say <em>&#x201C;Tom&#x2019;s speeches always sound good. This year, he won first prize in the international public speaking competition.&#x201D; </em>This type of phrasing makes you sound less formal and more conversational. </p><p>Which brings us to the next point.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505298537670-f32d119be330?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="How to Make Your Speech Sound Good" loading="lazy"><br>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote><strong><strong>Conversational mode is in our nature. As human beings, we first learn how to speak, then how to write. </strong></strong></blockquote><p>This is probably why the speaking part comes more as a reflex to us, something that author and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker called &#x201C;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct">the language instinct</a>&#x201D; </em>and, consequently, we don&#x2019;t put in as much effort as we do with writing. </p><p>When you sit in front of a white piece of paper, you activate your writing mode and express yourself in a way that you&#x2019;ve learned looks good on page. </p><p>Well, when it comes to speechwriting, you must treat things differently. </p><p><strong>You need to remember that the main purpose of a speech is for it to be spoken</strong>, so you must switch back to your speaking mode when writing it. </p><p>How do you do this? </p><p>Imagine having a conversation on a chat with a friend. Will you say: &#x201C;<em>Our group of friends will be meeting tonight, as a reservation was made for us at the restaurant named X, for 8 p.m. We shall see each other then.</em>&#x201D;? </p><p>This sounds unnatural and it is not the way you normally speak in a conversation. </p><p>Try to mentally put yourself in this scenario and use the tone and words that you would in a day-to-day conversation. </p><p>Practically, this might also mean <strong>using contracted forms of words</strong>, as this is the way we normally speak, and <strong>replacing formal names with pronouns</strong>.</p><p> However, <strong><em>do not </em>use short forms when you are trying to make an important point, as this might dilute the impact of your message.</strong> </p><p>Of course, you should always adjust your tone to the speech situation. </p><p>For instance, when delivering a speech on a very formal occasion, you might want to maintain a more balanced tone, one that is both ceremonious and clear. </p><p>Speaking about clarity...</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="3useroundnumbers">3. Use round numbers.</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What we&#x2019;ve learned so far is that <strong>the best way to get your message across is to make it clear and simple. </strong></p><p>Well, this is particularly true when you are trying to convey more complex information. </p><p>Depending on the type of speech you are giving, you might have to use numbers to make your point. </p><p>One way to make sure these statistics stick and make the desired impact on your audience is to <strong>round the numbers you are presenting</strong>. </p><p>Unless figure precision is crucial to your speech, you can help the audience better grasp the information by presenting them with a rounded approximation of that number. </p><p><strong>People are more likely to remember that your organization helped build over 1000 shelters for homeless people, rather than 1173 shelters.</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="4practiceoutloud">4.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>How do you know if your speech sounds good? </p><p>Well, first, you need to hear it. </p><p><strong>Read your sentences out loud as you write </strong>them and try to figure out the best way to perform them. </p><p>You don&#x2019;t have to wait until you finish writing the speech to start practicing its delivery. </p><p>In the beginning of this article, we&#x2019;ve mentioned that the main purpose of a speech is for it to be spoken. </p><p>Consequently, this means that for a speech to be good, the process of crafting it should be as much about writing as it is about speaking. </p><blockquote>Speaking while you write is the best way to improve your phrasing and adjust your tone as you work on your speech draft. </blockquote><p><strong>In the end</strong>, this is what writing for the ear really means: finding the right voice to deliver your speech in a way that fits its core message and sticks in the minds of those in the audience. <br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Plans Are Useless, but Planning Your Speech Is Indispensable]]></title><description><![CDATA[The job of a speaker is much like that of a tour guide.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To begin with, <strong>before you start writing, you need to decide on the type of speech you will deliver </strong>and choose the right type of structure, be that informative, persuasive, ceremonial etc. </p><p>You can do this by thinking about the reason you are giving the presentation, then move on to set the goal you wish to achieve through your talk. </p><p>For instance, if the main purpose of your speech is to share your knowledge or convey information on a certain topic, then you should look at an <strong>informative speech structure</strong>. </p><p>However, if your goal is to convince people to take a certain action following your speech, then you need to structure your speech in a <strong>persuasive</strong> manner. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="2draftyourmainpoints">2. Draft your main points.</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The next step towards a successfully structured speech is the outline of your main points. This is where you start drafting the main idea of your speech and its supporting arguments, following the structure you&#x2019;ve chosen in the previous step. </p><p>You begin with the<strong> topic</strong>, continue with the <strong>main arguments </strong>or pieces of information you want to share and then come up with <strong>examples, statistics or other details</strong> to support them. </p><p>You may want to limit the number of points you want to address and break each main point into smaller subsections to make your ideas easier to grasp.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="3arrangeyourideasinalogicalorder">3. Arrange your ideas in a logical order.</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The final step is the one that actually brings the &#x201C;structure&#x201D; part to your outline. </p><p>This is where you take all the ideas you&#x2019;ve written and arrange them in a logical order. </p><p>As we&#x2019;ve said before, for a speech to be good, it has to make sense. </p><blockquote><strong>Make your ideas flow naturally by arranging them in an order that supports and enhances the effect you want to have on your audience. </strong></blockquote><p>If you want them to understand a certain concept, <strong>give them the pieces of information gradually, moving from general to specific aspects</strong>. </p><p>Also, if you want people to be able to follow you throughout your presentation, you might want to <strong>use transition words that show how each piece of information connects with one another. </strong></p><h3 id="let-s-now-move-on-to-discuss-how-structure-helps-the-speaker-">Let&#x2019;s now move on to discuss how structure helps the speaker. </h3><p>Outlining helps you get your ideas in order and figure out the core message you want to send through your presentation. </p><p>It helps you both in the process of writing, as well as with the delivery of your speech. </p><p><strong>First</strong>, <strong>by putting your ideas on paper, you are able to decide what you need to say and how you should say it. </strong></p><p>At this point, you decide what to keep and what to toss, what helps you make your point and what doesn&#x2019;t. </p><blockquote>Outlining acts like a filtering process, helping you boil down your thoughts to just one important idea around which you can then build your argument. </blockquote><p>Once you have set the objective of your speech and its main pillars, all you need to do is build the bridges between these pillars.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>,<strong> by arranging your arguments in a naturally flowing order, you are also clearing the path towards a flawless delivery. </strong></p><p>As long as you have a clear, logical structure in your mind, you won&#x2019;t have to worry about forgetting your speech anymore. All you need to remember is your outline.</p><p>While these arguments may not be enough to make you consider outlining a vital part of your speech, you should note that compromising structure for whatever reason can be the recipe for the disaster of your speech: <strong>chaotic writing results in a chaotic delivery, which, in turn, will create nothing but chaos in your listeners&#x2019; minds. </strong></p><h3 id="now-that-we-ve-seen-what-structure-does-for-the-speaker-let-s-see-what-it-can-do-for-the-audience-">Now that we&#x2019;ve seen what structure does for the speaker, let&#x2019;s see what it can do for the audience.</h3><p></p><blockquote>For the information to be remembered, it needs to be understood.
